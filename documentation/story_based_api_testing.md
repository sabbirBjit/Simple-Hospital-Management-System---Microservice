# Hospital Management System - Story-Based API Testing Guide

## Overview
This guide provides a comprehensive story-based approach to testing all endpoints in the Hospital Management System microservices. The tests follow a realistic user journey from registration to appointment management.

## Prerequisites
- All microservices running (Auth, Patient, Appointment, Notification, API Gateway)
- API Gateway running on port 9000
- Direct service access available on ports 8081-8084
- JWT tokens will be obtained during the authentication flow

## üöÄ Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Start all microservices:
   ```bash
   # Start API Gateway (port 9000)
   # Start Auth Service (port 8081)
   # Start Patient Service (port 8082)
   # Start Appointment Service (port 8083)
   # Start Notification Service (port 8084)
   ```

2. Ensure databases are running and configured

3. Set up environment variables for tokens:
   ```bash
   export ADMIN_TOKEN="your_admin_token"
   export DOCTOR_TOKEN="your_doctor_token"
   export PATIENT_TOKEN="your_patient_token"
   ```

### Execution
1. Run the stories in sequence from 1 to 14
2. Each story builds upon the previous ones
3. Save tokens from authentication responses
4. Verify responses and error handling
5. Check system logs for any issues

### Expected Results
- All endpoints should return appropriate HTTP status codes
- JWT tokens should be valid and contain correct claims
- Role-based access should be enforced
- Data should be consistent across services
- Error messages should be informative
- Notifications should be sent successfully

## üìù Notes

1. **Token Management**: Always save JWT tokens from login responses and use them in subsequent requests
2. **Data Consistency**: Verify that data created in one service is accessible in others
3. **Error Handling**: Test both valid and invalid scenarios
4. **Performance**: Monitor response times and system resources
5. **Security**: Verify that unauthorized access is properly blocked
6. **Logging**: Check service logs for any errors or warnings

This comprehensive testing guide covers all aspects of the Hospital Management System and ensures thorough validation of the microservices architecture.
